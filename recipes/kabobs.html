    <h1>Yummy Honey Chicken Kabobs</h1>
    <img src="../images/chicken.jpeg" alt="Chicken Kabobs">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken kabobs marinated in a sweet and sour sauce are a fun alternative
        to usual barbecue fare. The honey-soy mixture does double duty as a marinade
        and a basting sauce, adding delicious flavor to every bite of juicy chicken.
        Use fresh mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, or other veggies and marinate overnight if desired.
        Don't have a grill? These can be cooked under your broiler.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Marinade:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
        <li>1/3 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Kabobs:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>8 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 inch cubes</li>
        <li>5 small onions, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 medium red bell peppers, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>12 bamboo skewers, or as needed, soaked in water for 30 minutes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together honey, soy sauce, oil, and black pepper for marinade
            in a large glass bowl. Remove 1/4 cup of the marinade to a small jar;
            seal and set aside to use while cooking.</li>
        <li>Add chicken, onions, bell peppers, and garlic to the marinade in the large bowl.
            Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Drain marinade from the chicken and vegetables, and discard marinade.
            Thread chicken and vegetables alternately onto skewers.</li>
        <li>Place kabobs on the preheated grill. Cook, turning frequently and brushing with the reserved marinade,
            until the chicken is no longer pink in the middle and the juices run clear, 12 to 15 minutes total.</li>
    </ol>
